Shallow Copy:

* Copies the memory addresses of dynamically allocated resources instead of creating a * new, independent copy.

* Both the original and the copied object share the same memory for the resource.

* Modifying the resource in one object affects the other, leading to aliasing issues.

* Typically done by the default copy constructor or assignment operator generated by the compiler.

Deep Copy:

* Creates an independent copy of the dynamically allocated resource, ensuring that the original and the copied object have their own separate resources.

* Modifying the resource in one object does not affect the other.

* Requires implementing a custom copy constructor or assignment operator.

| **Aspect**        | **Shallow Copy**                                      | **Deep Copy**                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource**       | Shares the same memory for dynamically allocated data | Allocates new memory and copies the data          |
| **Performance**    | Faster (just copies pointers)                        | Slower (allocates memory and copies content)      |
| **Independence**   | Original and copy affect each other                  | Original and copy are independent                |
| **Use Case**       | Suitable for non-owning pointers                     | Necessary for owning pointers (like in RAII)     |

### **What is a Member-Wise Shallow Copy?**

A **member-wise shallow copy** means that each member of an object is copied directly to the corresponding member of another object **without duplicating dynamically allocated memory or other external resources**.

For **simple types** (like `int`, `double`, or `bool`), this is fine because they are self-contained. But for **complex types** (like pointers or objects with dynamic memory), this can lead to problems since only the pointer is copied, not the memory it points to.

### **How Does Member-Wise Shallow Copy Work?**

When you copy an object using a **shallow copy**, the compiler:
1. **Directly copies each non-static member of the source object to the destination object.**
   - For primitive types, the value is copied.
   - For pointers, the address is copied (not the memory they point to).
2. **Does not allocate new memory for dynamically allocated resources.**
